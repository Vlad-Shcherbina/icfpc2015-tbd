ICFPC 2015 team TBD submission deployment and running instructions.
===

This submission uses Nix package manager to fetch dependencies and
Nix-shell to make sure that those exact dependencies are used on
any distro.

Notice that if you don't re-login, after you ran ``make``, you'll have to source
file ``~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh`` in every shell spawned,
so, if you want to run some automated scripts that spawn shells, please
make sure to relogin after you ran ``make``!

Because Nix package manager is non-intrusive (and not compatible, for
that matter) with conventional package managers of other Linux distros,
please be considerate about the fact that first run of ``make`` takes some time.

TL;DR instructions:

 1. Get to environment for running submission by executing

    $ make && . ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh && nix-shell

 2. From nix-shell, run submissions the regular way
	
    $ ./play_icfp2015 -f data/qualifier/problem_20.json -t 10 -m 20 -p "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn."

 3. Run our submission for no less than thirteen minutes as one who runs 
    this code for less shalt be consumed by K'tulu last.
